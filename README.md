Everyone should know this: Your fridge is loaded with vegetables, meat und fruits and after some days, things you don't even remember start to mold. Our MoldMonitor solves this problem.

The MoldMonitor as you can see on the images is a small microcontroller attached to a display, a button and a potentiometer. Brought together in a nice case that you can clip right on a can in your fridge or attach it on the outside of your fridge.

You have to use the button to select the fruit or the expiration date. With the regulator you can choose the days left or the type of the food. You can see if some food is going to hit its expiration date by just checking the days left. Also you will see the days colored in yellow or red depending on the day value.
